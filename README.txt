The scripts in this repo have the following functionalities:
1) data_exploration.py:
This script performs an exploratory data analysis. It plots basic histograms and graphs to get a grip on the data.
Finally, a simple KNN classifier is trained, in order to get a first estimate of a baseline accuracy value

2) PCA.py:
This script executes a series of preprocessing steps and finally performs a Principal Component Analysis to reduce the
size of the data set. Moreover, it splits the data in training and test set and stores them in 2 separate files,
'Train.csv' and 'Test.csv'. Finally, it calculates the accuracy score of a KNN algorithm to estimate the loss of
accuracy that was introduced by the dimensionality reduction

3) model_selection.py:
This script loads the transformed training set with reduced dimensions (153 principal components) that was created in
the previous step and compares different classifiers using a 5-fold cross validation scheme. The training data are stored
in the file "Train.csv" that was generated by the "PCA.py" python script. The parameters of the different classifiers 
are tuned manually inside the script. All accuracy score results are stored in a DataFrame and are printed at the end
of the script's execution. It's worth noting that the Gradient Boost algorithm at the end of the script took extremely
long to train. Therefore, the corresponding lines are commented out.

4) Hyperparameter_tuning.py
This script conducts a hyperparameter tuning of SVM for our problem. This happens in gradual steps. Moreover, the
test set is imported and the final evaluation of the selected model takes place and the results are printed.
